## Errors and warnings

You will always ignore the following error:
`'main' attribute cannot be used in a module that contains top-level code` inside the [HyprCutsApp.swift](mdc:HyprCuts/HyprCutsApp.swift)

## Guidelines

You will **NEVER** create files.
You will check the current code structure to see if there isn't a file which should be updated instead.
If you really, really need to create a file, you will prove me to create a file.
